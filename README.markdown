I am already working on a new version of `arara`. According to my numbers, it will be version `6.0` (I might explain *why* in the documentation later on). A lot of new features, improvements and changes are on their way. And also ducks.

Note that there will soon be a repository cleanup. For now, this is just a friendly announcement. `:)`
