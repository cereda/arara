`arara` is a TeX automation tool based on rules and directives. It gives you a way to enhance your TeX experience. The tool is an effort to provide a concise way to automate the daily TeX workflow for users and also package writers. Users might write their own rules when the provided ones do not suffice.

## Basic use

To use `arara`, you need to tell it what to do. Unlike most other tools, you give `arara` these _directives_ in the document itself â€“ usually near the top.  So to run `pdflatex` once on your document, you should say something like:

```tex
% arara: pdflatex
\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}
Hello, world!
\end{document}
```

Now when you run `arara myfile`, that directive (`% arara: ...`) will be seen and carried out as described by the `pdflatex` rule.  You can read more about rules and directives in the user manual available in our [releases](https://github.com/cereda/arara/releases) section. In addition to documenting all of the rules that come standard with `arara`, the manual gives a detailed explanation of how `arara` works, as well as how to create and use your own rules.

## Versions

The stable major version of `arara` is the 4.0 series (note that revision numbers may vary). Please refer to the development branch for more information on the upcoming 5.0 series release. The master branch always refers to the stable version (including potential revisions). The CTAN packaging for the current version is 4.0.6 (for internal use).

For historical purposes, the source code for older versions of `arara` is available in the [releases](https://github.com/cereda/arara/releases) section of our repository. However, be mindful that these versions are unsupported.

## Build status

`arara` uses [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org) as a hosted continuous integration service. For each and every commit, we can see in real time the build status of our application checked against a range of Java VM vendors. It is worth noting that the current series is designed and built to be Java 5.0 compliant, so if you have an old JVM, it is almost sure that you will be able to run `arara` in it without any problems.

From the 4.0 series on, the team decided to not release cross-platform installers any more. Our tool is available out of the shelf on all major TeX distributions, including TeX Live and MiKTeX, which makes manual installation unnecessary given the significant coverage of such distributions. Chances are you already have `arara` in your system!

You can obtain the official package available in the [releases](https://github.com/cereda/arara/releases) section of our project repository, as well as the [Bintray](https://bintray.com/cereda/arara) software distribution service. Please refer to the documentation on how to manually deploy our tool.
